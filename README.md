# Data Ingestion using NiFi

We are glad to come up with Tech Series on Mondays where we will be talking about a particular topic between 4 to 8 weeks. Some of them will be free and some of them will be paid. In case you want to get notified in case of events, please sign up to our Meetup group - https://www.meetup.com/itversityin/

NiFi is one of the key tools in the area of Data Engineering and Big Data. It is primarily used for Data Ingestion and Orchestration. As part of 6 to 8 workshops between August and September, you will be learning key capabilities. Live sessions will be free and pre-recorded videos will be available exclusively for members of our YouTube channel.

As part of the first demo, I will demonstrate key capabilities.

* Overview of NiFi
* Understanding NiFi Layout as a service
* Key Concepts such as Flow Files, Attributes etc
* Understanding how to access the documentation
* Simple pipeline to copy files from Local File System and HDFS

However, there are quite a few advanced capabilities which I will be covering as part of the Tech Workshop Series on Mondays (6 to 8 Sessions):

* Setting up of NiFi in a single node.
* Building generic data ingestion flows
* Converting File Formats
* Writing conditional flows based upon attributes
* Triggering Shell Commands or Spark Jobs
* Transforming inflight data
* Logging Attributes and Messages
* Scheduling, Monitoring, and Alerting
and many more

Key Takeaways for those who sign up for the workshop.:

* Free end to end workshop to provide data ingestion solutions using NiFi
* Live support for members in case if our YouTube members are struggling to take care of setting up the environment.
* Limited support using Slack
